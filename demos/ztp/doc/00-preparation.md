# OpenShift ZTP demo preparation

## Environment & Hardware Requirements

* **OpenShift "Hub" Cluster**: Typically configured with 3 worker nodes, each having 8 cores and 16GB of memory.
* **OpenShift "Edge" Clusters**: At least one additional OpenShift cluster (minimal resources are acceptable).

  > **Note**
  >
  > The "Hub" Cluster is where ACM is deployed. For this demo, it will serve as the "Cloud" cluster.

## Environment Setup






















### Recommended Hardware

For the central site, deploying the OpenShift Hub cluster on AWS is recommended due to its ease of setup and scalability. However, OpenShift can also be deployed on other supported environments, including bare-metal serversâ€”though this is not recommended for a demo due to the significant CPU and memory requirements.

For the edge site, the demo can be run on VMs or any `x86_64` server capable of running RHEL (this demo has not been tested with `aarch64`). The server should have at least 8 vCPUs, 16GB of memory, and 100GB of storage. Additionally, the server must have a USB port for booting from an ISO.

> **IMPORTANT**  
> There is currently an [issue](https://issues.redhat.com/browse/MGMT-18693) with the USB partition table when created with the OpenShift Appliance ISOs (covered in Section 3 of this demo). This issue may prevent your system from booting directly from the USB. If you encounter this problem, consider using the RAW image (for both physical and virtual systems) or deploying the OpenShift Appliance in a VM (mounting with Virtual Media is not affected).

If you are using physical hardware, the following equipment is recommended:

- One x86 server for the SNO device (8 CPU cores, 16GB RAM, 100GB+ disk, and one NIC). For Demo Section 2 (GitOps Provisioning with ACM), the server should have a Redfish BMC. If BMC is not available, consider using a VM with a virtual BMC for that section.
- Two USB keys, one with at least 64GB capacity.
- A USB keyboard (a USB RFID mini keyboard is suitable, but avoid Bluetooth-only models).
- A video cable and possibly an HDMI-DisplayPort adapter and an external monitor for boot console display. Alternatively, use a video capture card to view the physical device's video output on your laptop.
- A router capable of configuring PAT rules and/or a VPN.
- A network switch if your router/AP lacks sufficient free interfaces.
- At least three RJ45 cables.
- Depending on your laptop, additional adapters (e.g., RJ45 or HDMI) may be necessary. For example, some venues using HDMI over RJ45 may require specific adapters to ensure proper screen mirroring.

### Required Connectivity

Since OpenShift is being installed, you will need to configure the necessary DNS entries, including a wildcard, on a DNS server.

The level of network connectivity required between the central site and the edge location varies depending on the demo section:

#### Section 1 - Assisted Installer with Advanced Cluster Management

Red Hat Advanced Cluster Management (ACM) requires access to the device's OpenShift API. You can achieve this by either configuring NAT port forwarding for TCP/6443 to the SNO server or by establishing a VPN between the local network and the environment where ACM is running (e.g., AWS).

If using a VPN and deploying ACM on AWS, the [`tools` section](../../tools/) includes an [Ansible Playbook](../../tools/aws_vpn/README.md) to help create a VPN between AWS and your local Linux KVM server/laptop or OpenWRT router.

#### Section 2 - GitOps Provisioning with Advanced Cluster Management

ACM needs access to both the OpenShift API and the Redfish BMC (default port TCP/8000). Port NAT can be configured for the API, and potentially for the BMC, but this section also requires direct connectivity. The device must download the "Discovery ISO" from one of the OpenShift Hub Cluster nodes' private IPs, which necessitates a VPN if the edge device is not on the same network as ACM.

#### Section 3 - OpenShift Appliance

This section does not require a central site; in fact, the edge location can be entirely disconnected, provided the correct DNS entries are configured locally. You only need an Internet connection on the laptop or system where you create the OpenShift Appliance images.
